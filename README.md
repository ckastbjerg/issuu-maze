## Todo

Hackday goals:
- [ ] Deploy on heroku
- [x] Beautify code
- [x] Add takana
- [x] Create custom 3d reader (load individual pages when document cover is clicked)
- [x] Allow multiple searches (without reloading)
- [ ] cue up clicks for reader to enhance experience...
- [ ] Have documents transition in when search is performed (like in "The Matrix" weapon scene!)

Nice to have:
- [ ] Create overlay when hovering document cover to display some metadata
- [ ] Fix covers/pages being inverted
- [ ] Add prefixing
- [ ] Improove rotation (currently walls gets in the way)
- [ ] Don't allow walking through walls
- [ ] Only render visible documents to screen
- [ ] Create option to configure maze layout runtime (a map editor)
- [ ] Improove wall generation algorithm (in some scenarios walls colide)
- [ ] Add arms/gun/something like in a FPS (oh yeah!)
